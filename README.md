# rustlock

This is a password manager that I am making just for learning both how password managers and Rust work. 

This app is based off example code from [this](https://github.com/zupzup/rust-commandline-example) repository.

## Installation

Ensure that you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) installed

Clone the repository with whichever method you prefer.

Navigate to the directory to where the repository was cloned and run ```cargo run``` in the terminal.
